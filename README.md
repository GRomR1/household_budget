## Getting Started

### Configure database access

The project uses MySQL database. Tests and deployment it will become easy with [PythonAnywhere](https://pythonanywhere.com) service. 
View [official](https://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/) docs about these processes for addition information.
If you want to use your local DB instance or SQLite database, you should find in [settings.py](household_budget/settings.py) file next strings:

```
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'GRomR1$household_budget',
        'USER': 'GRomR1',
        'PASSWORD': 'passw0rd',
        'HOST': 'GRomR1.mysql.pythonanywhere-services.com'
    }
}
```

Edit this to correct config data about your host, username and etc. Or use SQLite:

```
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
    }
}
```
